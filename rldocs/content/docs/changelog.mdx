Here are some of the user-facing changes we've made to RunRL recently.

## October 11, 2025
- **LoRA Support**: Added comprehensive support for parameter-efficient fine-tuning with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
  - Enables 2-3× faster training with significantly reduced memory usage
  - New parameters: `use_lora`, `lora_rank`, `lora_alpha`, `lora_dropout`
  - Automatic MoE detection: Mixture-of-Experts models (e.g., Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct) now automatically use attention-only LoRA for vLLM compatibility
  - Python SDK updated to v0.2.2 with full LoRA documentation and examples

## October 3, 2025
- **Dataset wizard** (beta): Easily generate reward functions by uploading a dataset and describing the task you want an LLM to improve at 
- **API parity with the UI**: The REST API now covers every user-facing feature—files, runs, deployments, tools, shared configurations, validation, and search.
- **Docs refresh**: Completely overhauled API docs with end-to-end examples and coverage of new endpoints.

## September 29, 2025
- **SFT warmups**: You can now provide a dataset of examples to run SFT on before RL, boosting early performance

## September 25, 2025
- **Completions display**: Improved display for model completions in multi-turn environments
