# Installation & Setup

The RunRL Python SDK (`runrl`) provides a typed client for the RunRL REST API. This page covers
installation, authentication, and a minimal smoke test.

## 1. Install the SDK

```bash
pip install runrl==0.2.0
```

The package supports Python 3.9+ and ships with both synchronous and asynchronous clients. It does
not install heavy ML dependenciesâ€”only standard HTTP tooling (httpx + pydantic).

## 2. Configure Credentials

Generate an API key from the RunRL dashboard and expose it to your environment. The client reads the
`RUNRL_API_KEY` variable automatically; you can also pass it explicitly.

```bash
export RUNRL_API_KEY="rl_your_api_key"

# Optional: target staging or local environments
export RUNRL_BASE_URL="https://staging.runrl.com/api/v1"
```

## 3. Verify Connectivity

```python
from runrl import RunRLClient

client = RunRLClient()
print(client.config.base_url)

# list your files to ensure auth works
files = client.files.list(per_page=5)
for file in files.items:
    print(file.id, file.name, file.type)
```

If this returns a `AuthenticationError`, double-check the API key. Network or SSL errors typically
indicate proxies/firewalls blocking the request.

## 4. Optional: Async Client

```python
import asyncio
from runrl import AsyncRunRLClient


async def main():
    async with AsyncRunRLClient() as client:
        files = await client.files.list(per_page=3)
        print([f.name for f in files.items])

asyncio.run(main())
```

## 5. Local Development Helpers

- **User agent**: Overwrite via `RunRLClient(user_agent="my-app/0.1.0")`.
- **Timeouts**: `RunRLClient(timeout=60)` adjusts HTTP timeouts.
- **Polling intervals**: `RunRLClient(poll_interval=10)` tunes future polling frequency.

With the SDK installed and authenticated, continue to [Launch Your First Run](/python/authentication)
or jump straight to the [API Reference](/python/api-reference).
