## First-Time Setup Checklist

Before creating your first run:

- [ ] **Email verified** and account activated
- [ ] **Billing information** added and validated
- [ ] **Understanding of costs** - $80/hour for active runs
- [ ] **Prompt file prepared** in correct JSONL format
- [ ] **Reward function written** or environment class defined

## Understanding Costs

### Billing Model
- **$80 per hour** per active training run
- **Billing starts** when run status changes to "RUNNING"
- **Billing stops** when run completes, fails, or is cancelled
- **Minimum charge**: Rounded to nearest minute

### Cost Management Tips
1. **Start small** - Test with 1 epoch and short completion lengths
2. **Monitor actively** - Check progress every 15-30 minutes
3. **Cancel if needed** - Don't hesitate to stop unprofitable runs
4. **Use dashboard** - Track real-time costs across all runs

## Test Your Setup

### Create a Test Run
1. **Prepare minimal data** - 5-10 sample prompts
2. **Use simple reward function** - Basic length or keyword checking
3. **Set minimal settings** - 1 epoch, 128 completion length
4. **Monitor for 10 minutes** - Verify metrics are flowing
5. **Cancel test run** - Practice cost control

### Expected Costs
- **10-minute test**: ~$13-15
- **1-hour experiment**: $80
- **Full training run**: $160-400 depending on duration

## Common Setup Issues

### "Billing not configured"
**Solution**: Add payment method in Settings > Billing

### "File upload failed"
**Solution**: 
- Check file format (JSONL for prompts)
- Verify file size under 50MB
- Ensure valid JSON on each line with same fields

### "Model not found"
**Solution**:
- Check model name spelling
- Ensure model exists on HuggingFace
