# Installation

The RunRL Python client can be easily installed using pip or uv, Python package managers.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip or uv (Python package managers)

## Installing from PyPI

The recommended way to install RunRL is via pip or uv:

```bash
# Using pip
pip install runrl

# Using uv
uv pip install runrl
```

This will install the latest stable version (0.1.15) of the RunRL client library and all its dependencies.

## Installing a Specific Version

If you need to install a specific version of RunRL:

```bash
# Using pip
pip install runrl==0.1.15  # Or another specific version

# Using uv
uv pip install runrl==0.1.15  # Or another specific version
```

## Upgrading

To upgrade to the latest version:

```bash
# Using pip
pip install --upgrade runrl

# Using uv
uv pip install --upgrade runrl
```

## Installing from Source

For development purposes, you can install RunRL directly from the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/runrl/runrl.git
cd runrl
# Using pip
pip install -e .
# Using uv
uv pip install -e .
```

## Verifying Installation

You can verify that RunRL is installed correctly by importing it in Python:

```python
import runrl
print(runrl.__version__)  # Should print the installed version
```

## Dependencies

RunRL depends on the following Python packages, which will be automatically installed:

- `requests`: For making HTTP requests to the RunRL API
- `websockets`: For streaming logs via WebSockets
- `asyncio`: For asynchronous operations

## Next Steps

After installation, you'll need to [authenticate](/docs/authentication) with your API key to start using RunRL.
