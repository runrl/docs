# Authentication

The RunRL client uses API key authentication to securely access the RunRL API. This page explains how to obtain and use your API key.

## Obtaining an API Key

To obtain an API key:

1. Sign up for an account at [RunRL](https://runrl.com)
2. Navigate to your account settings
3. Generate a new API key
4. Copy the API key (it starts with `rl-`)

## Using Your API Key

When initializing the RunRL client, you need to provide your API key:

```python
from runrl import RunRL

# Initialize with your API key
client = RunRL(api_key="rl-your-api-key")
```

## API Key Validation

The RunRL client automatically validates your API key when you initialize it:

```python
try:
    client = RunRL(api_key="rl-your-api-key")
    print("API key is valid!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"API key validation failed: {e}")
```

## Environment Variables

For security best practices, it's recommended to store your API key as an environment variable rather than hardcoding it in your scripts:

```python
import os
from runrl import RunRL

# Get API key from environment variable
api_key = os.environ.get("RUNRL_API_KEY")
if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("RUNRL_API_KEY environment variable not set")

client = RunRL(api_key=api_key)
```

You can set the environment variable in your shell:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
export RUNRL_API_KEY="rl-your-api-key"

# Windows (Command Prompt)
set RUNRL_API_KEY=rl-your-api-key

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:RUNRL_API_KEY="rl-your-api-key"
```

## Custom API Endpoints

By default, the RunRL client connects to the standard RunRL API endpoint. If you need to use a different endpoint (e.g., for testing or private deployments), you can specify it when initializing the client:

```python
client = RunRL(
    api_key="rl-your-api-key",
    base_url="https://custom-api.example.com"
)
```

## API Key Security

Keep your API key secure:

- Never commit your API key to version control
- Don't share your API key in public forums or documentation
- Rotate your API key periodically
- Use environment variables or secure secret management tools

## Error Handling

If authentication fails, the RunRL client will raise an `AuthenticationError`:

```python
from runrl import RunRL, AuthenticationError

try:
    client = RunRL(api_key="invalid-api-key")
except AuthenticationError as e:
    print(f"Authentication failed: {e}")
```

## Next Steps

Once you've successfully authenticated, you can start using the RunRL client to [manage your runs](/docs/api-reference#runs) and other resources.
