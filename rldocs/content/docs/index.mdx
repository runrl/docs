# RunRL

RunRL is a Python client library for interacting with the RunRL API, which provides tools for training and deploying machine learning models.

## Overview

The RunRL client library provides a simple and intuitive interface for:

- Managing training runs
- Uploading and managing prompt and reward files
- Downloading and deploying trained models
- Monitoring training metrics and logs
- Accessing GPU pricing information

## Quick Start

```python
from runrl import RunRL

# Initialize the client with your API key
client = RunRL(api_key="rl-your-api-key")

# List your runs
runs = client.list_runs()
print(f"You have {len(runs)} runs")

# Upload prompt and reward files
prompt_file = client.upload_prompt_file("path/to/prompt.jsonl", "My Prompt File")
print(f"Uploaded prompt file with ID: {prompt_file['id']}")

reward_file = client.upload_reward_file("path/to/reward.jsonl", "My Reward File")
print(f"Uploaded reward file with ID: {reward_file['id']}")

# Launch a training run
run = client.create_run(
    model_name="Qwen/Qwen3-4B",
    prompt_file=prompt_file['id'],
    reward_file=reward_file['id'],
    epochs=2,
    learning_rate=2e-6
)
print(f"Created run with ID: {run['id']}")

# Check run status
run_details = client.get_run_details(run['id'])
print(f"Run status: {run_details['status']}")
```
