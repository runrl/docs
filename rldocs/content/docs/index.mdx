## Overview

The RunRL platform provides a simple yet powerful interface for training models with a variety of reinforcement learning algorithms on arbitrary prompt and reward files.

### Basic setup

An RL run consists of three necessary components:

* the **model**, which is the base model being trained;
* the **prompts**, which represent the queries the model is responding to; and one of the following
 * the **reward function**, which evaluates the quality of the model's responses.
 * the **environment class**, which includes a initialization function and a step function that
