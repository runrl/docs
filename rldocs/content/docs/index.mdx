The RunRL platform provides a simple yet powerful interface for training LLMs with reinforcement learning on arbitrary prompt and reward files.

## Setup

An RL run consists of three main components:

* a **base model**, such as Qwen3 4B
* **prompts**, the inputs to the model
* either a **reward function** or **environment class**, which score model outputs

Additionally, you can specify:
* [MCP tools](tools) for your model to call
* Hyperparameters such as learning rate multiplier and number of epochs
