# Motte.ai Documentation

RunRL is a platform for improving models and agents with reinforcement learning.

## Overview

The RunRL platform provides a simple yet powerful interface for training models with a variety of reinforcement learning algorithms on arbitrary prompt and reward files.

### Basic setup

An RL run consists of three necessary components:

* the **model**, which is the base model being trained;
* the **prompts**, which represent the queries the model is responding to; and
* the **reward function**, which evaluates the quality of the model's responses.
